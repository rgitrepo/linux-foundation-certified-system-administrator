Creating actual screenshots is outside my current capabilities, but I can provide you with detailed explanations and simulated command-line inputs and outputs for `--help`, `man`, `apropos`, and using autocomplete with Tab. This should help you visualize what you would see in a terminal window.

### 1. `--help` Option

The `--help` option with a command in the Linux terminal provides a quick overview of how to use the command, its options, and sometimes examples of its usage. It's a fast way to get help directly in the terminal without diving into the more detailed manual pages.

**Example Command:**
```bash
ls --help
```

**Simulated Output:**
```
Usage: ls [OPTION]... [FILE]...
List information about the FILEs (the current directory by default).
Sort entries alphabetically if none of -cftuvSUX nor --sort is specified.

  -a, --all                  do not ignore entries starting with .
  -l                         use a long listing format
  --help                     display this help and exit
  --version                  output version information and exit
```

### 2. `man` Command

The `man` command opens the manual page for a given command, providing a comprehensive overview of the command, its syntax, options, and often examples of how to use it. It's the go-to for detailed documentation about Linux commands.

**Example Command:**
```bash
man ls
```

**Simulated Output:**
```
LS(1)                     User Commands                    LS(1)

NAME
       ls - list directory contents

SYNOPSIS
       ls [OPTION]... [FILE]...

DESCRIPTION
       List information about the FILEs (the current directory by default).
...
```

### 3. `apropos` Command

The `apropos` command searches the manual page names and descriptions for a given keyword and returns a list of commands related to that keyword. It's useful when you're not sure about the exact command you need.

**Example Command:**
```bash
apropos search
```

**Simulated Output:**
```
grep (1)              - print lines matching a pattern
find (1)              - search for files in a directory hierarchy
locate (1)            - find files by name
...
```

### 4. Autocomplete Using Tab

In the terminal, when you start typing a command or file path and press the Tab key, the terminal tries to autocomplete what you're typing based on the available commands and files. If there's only one possible completion, it will complete the command or filename for you. If there are multiple, pressing Tab twice will list the possibilities.

**Example Usage:**

When you type `cd Doc` and then press Tab, if there's only one directory starting with "Doc," the terminal will autocomplete it to `cd Documents/`.

If you're not sure of a command, start typing it and press Tab twice to see available commands. For example, typing `apt-get ins` and pressing Tab twice might show:

```
install      - Command to install a new package
```
